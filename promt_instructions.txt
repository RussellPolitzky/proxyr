Build an R plugin to handle proxy servers.  The package should contain a
function called with_proxy().

The function is invoked as follows:

    with_proxy({
        # Do things that need the proxy to be active here.
        # When this code runs the assigned proxy is active.
        # When this code exits the assigned proxy is no longer active.
    }

The function should set the proxy for the R session to the proxy server specified by the user.
If should also include a URL encoded username and password if the proxy requires authentication.
The proxy must be set using environment variables.

The with_proxy function should also include a try finally block to ensure that 
proxy settings are restored to their original state even if an error occurs.

The with proxy function does not take a URL because it only sets the proxy environment variables.  
Code code within its scope will make the URL calls.

Any code called within the scope of with_proxy() should use the proxy settings specified by the user.

The function must store any ambient proxy settings before execution and should restore them
after execution to ensure that the proxy settings are not changed.

The proxy username and password should be stored in the windows credential manager using the 
keyring package in R.

The package must allow users to capture the proxy details and store them in the windows credential manager.

The package must allow users to remove the proxy details from the windows credential manager.

The package must allow users to list the proxy details stored in the windows credential manager.

The package must include appropriate tests using the testhat package.  The tests must be run using the testthat package
and should use an open proxy server to test the functionality.

The package must be built using the devtools package in R. It should be built to comply with CRAN policies.

Use a git repo for this project.  The git repo should be hosted on github.
